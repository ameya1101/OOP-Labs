## Lab 3

### Question 3.1
Create a class `Circle` such that:
- It has 3 fields of integer type called `x`, `y`, and `radius`;
- It has a class level field for pi; and
- It has three constructors:
    - Three-argument constructor which sets all field values;
    - A two-argument constructor that sets `x` and `y` and `radius` to zero; and
    - A no-argument constructor that sets all fields to zero.
- Create private getter and setter methods for X and Y.
- Provide a `setCenter(a, b)` and `printCenter()` method.
- Provide a `translate(a, b)` method that moves the center to (x+a, y+b)
- Provide an `area()` method that returns the area.

### Question 3.2
Create a class `UseCircle` which has the `main()` method that
- Creates three `Circle` objects using the three available constructors;
- Sets the parameters of the no-argument object;
- Sets the radius of the two-argument object to one;
- Translates one of the circles; and
- Prints the center, radius and area of each circle object.
